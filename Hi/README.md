<p class=MsoNormal>The dipole antenna or dipole aerial is one of the most
important forms of RF antenna. The dipole can be used on its own, or it can
form part of a more complicated antenna array.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dipole aerial or antenna is widely used on its own, but
it is also incorporated into many other RF antenna designs where it forms the
radiating or driven element for the overall antenna.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dipole is relatively simple in its basic implementation
and many of the basic calculations are quite straightforward. It is easy to
design a basic dipole antenna that will operate on the HF, VHF and UHF sections
of the radio frequency spectrum. That said, in depth mathematical analysis can
require more complicated mathematical methods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A dipole antenna</b> is a straight electrical conductor
measuring half wavelength from end to end and connected at the center to a
radio-frequency (RF) feed line. This antenna, also called a doublet, is one of
the simplest types of antenna, and constitutes the main RF radiating and
receiving element in various sophisticated types of antennas. The dipole is
inherently a balanced antenna, because it is bilaterally symmetrical.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The name 'di-pole' indicates that the dipole antenna
consists of two poles or items â€“ two conductive elements. Current flows in
these two conductive elements and the current and the associated voltage causes
an electromagnetic wave or radio signal to be radiated outwards from the
antenna.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The length of the radiating elements determine many of the
properties of the dipole antenna: its feed impedance, <span class=SpellE>centre</span>
operating frequency, whether it is a resonant antenna, <span class=GramE>etc..</span>
As such the dipole length is an important aspect of the dipole antenna
parameters.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Conclusion & Outcome<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dipole antenna is a particularly important form of RF antenna which is very widely used for radio transmitting and receiving applications. The dipole is often used on its own as an RF antenna, but it also forms the essential element in many other types of RF antenna. As such it is the possibly the most important form of RF antenna.</p>
